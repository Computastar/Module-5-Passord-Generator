# Module 5 Challenge: Password Generator

## Introduction

After having the week from hell with technology, firstly some kind gentlemen putting his spade through my fibre connection at the end of the street leaving me without broadband and relying on 4G, followed by a laptop versus cup of tea incident, where the laptop definitely came off worst, I wasn’t looking forward to this challenge.

Given that I was already late submitting, I thought I'd implement some of the features we had learnt post this challenge. It uses plenty of jquery, especially around the jqueryUI, to provide modal form to capture the user’s password criteria. This was a bit of a challenge but got it working and formatted nicely. The actual code for creating a password form the selection was relativity easy. Overall, I enjoyed the challenge, pushing myself on jqueryUI even after a tough week.

## Challenge Overview
 
This week’s challenge is to create an application that an employee can use to generate a random password based on criteria they’ve selected. This app will run in the browser and will feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code. It will have a clean and polished user interface that is responsive, ensuring that it adapts to multiple screen sizes.


The password can include special characters. If you’re unfamiliar with these, see this [list of Password Special Characters from the OWASP Foundation](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Password_special_characters).
